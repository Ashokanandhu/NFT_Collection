# NFT_Collection
A decentralised web app to mint nft from the given  nft collection.

## Statement of Purpose
My name is Anandhu Ashok, 
I have a very exciting tutorial lined up. NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are all the buzz these days, from BoredApes to Crypto Kitties EVERYONE is talking about them.
I am building 'your own NFT marketplace' from complete scratch.
We will be setting up a minting price for our NFTs so that we can make some money for our NFT collection.
We will also setup a maximum limit on the number of NFTs one public address can buy, so that more people can get their hands on our super popular NFT collection.
But how will a user mint our super popular NFT collection? Because an average user isn’t a top-notch programmer like you and me, so I think we should also make up a simple react webpage where the user can mint our NFTs on the click of a button.

This is a great head start for anyone looking to create NFT collection or a marketplace and making money through it. This is how our marketplace will look like. 

## Course Overview:

1. We will start of with setting up our development environment and downloading all the dependencies. The tech stack we will be using - Hardhat, Alchemy, Pinata, 
   React and Ethers.js
2. We will then use the openzepellin library’s ERC721 smart contract, and inherit it to create our own NFT smart contract called Collection.sol
3. After that we will need to deploy our smart contract using 'ethers.js' and check our deployment on 'etherscan'.
4. we’ll make a very simple react frontend for our website.
5. This webpage will be able to list 5 NFTs
6. A user would be able to connect to their metamask and mint any 2 of these NFTs.

   And that’s it, you will now be able to see and enjoy your NFT in your own metamask wallet!
